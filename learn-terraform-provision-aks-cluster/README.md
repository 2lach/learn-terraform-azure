# Learn Terraform - Provision AKS Cluster

This repo is a companion repo to the [Provision an AKS Cluster learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/kubernetes/provision-aks-cluster), containing Terraform configuration files to provision an AKS cluster on Azure.

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications on Azure.

In this tutorial, you will deploy a 2 node AKS cluster on your default VPC using Terraform then access its Kubernetes dashboard.
